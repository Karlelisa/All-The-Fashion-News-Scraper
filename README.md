# Vogue Scraper - The Latest Fashion News

## Description
Whenever a user visits the Vogue Scraper site, the app scrapes stories from vogue.com and displays them for the user. Each scraped article is saved to my MongoDB. My app scrapes and displays the following information for each article:


* Headline - the title of the article
* URL - the url to the original article
* Image - the image of the original article


Users are able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to my MongoDB as well and associated with their articles. Users are also able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments are visible to every user.
